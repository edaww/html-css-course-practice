CSS Box Model

If you wanna target all the text in your code:
<style>
p {
font-family: Arial;
margin-top: 0px;
margin-bottom: 20px
}

*** If there are multiple lines setting the same property: the browser follows the priority order.
More specific selector has more priority.
class name selector > element name selector

Text element: they can exist inside a line of text without affecting the rest of the text.
*** span element is useful cuz it comes with no style. We can give it a class.
